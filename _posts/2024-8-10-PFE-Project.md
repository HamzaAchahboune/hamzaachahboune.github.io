# Project Title: Centralized Log Management with ELK Stack
![cires](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e051a57-4523-48c0-a667-deb0e443cc5e)
## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a centralized log management system using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), along with Beats agents (Filebeat and Packetbeat). The aim is to efficiently collect, centralize, analyze, and visualize log data and network traffic from various sources, enhancing the overall observability and security of IT infrastructure.

### Problem Statement

Managing and analyzing logs from multiple servers, applications, and network devices is a critical challenge for organizations. Traditional log management solutions often struggle with scalability and real-time analysis, leading to inefficiencies in detecting and responding to issues. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a centralized log management system using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Beats agents (Filebeat and Packetbeat), enabling efficient, real-time log collection, analysis, and visualization.

### Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Centralized Log Management**: Implement a unified system for collecting and managing logs from various sources such as servers, applications, and network devices.
   
2. **Real-Time Monitoring and Analysis**: Enable real-time analysis and visualization of logs to quickly identify and address issues as they arise.

3. **Scalability**: Design the solution to handle large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring it can scale with the organization's needs.

4. **Enhanced Security**: Ensure that the log management system adheres to best practices in security, protecting sensitive data, and providing robust monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to security threats.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Utilize open-source tools to create a cost-efficient solution that provides comprehensive log management and analysis capabilities.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Elasticsearch**: A powerful search and analytics engine that stores and indexes log data.
- **Logstash**: A data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and sends data to Elasticsearch (optional in my implementation).
- **Kibana**: A visualization tool that works with Elasticsearch, providing dashboards and visualizations.
- **Filebeat**: A lightweight shipper that collects and forwards log files to Elasticsearch.
- **Packetbeat**: A real-time network packet analyzer that sends data to Elasticsearch.
- **Ubuntu**: The operating system used to manage and run the various components of the project.
- **GNS3**: A network simulation tool used for testing and configuring network components.
- **VMware**: A virtualization tool that hosts different environments needed for testing and development.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a crucial technology that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications. It combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) to offer a comprehensive view of an organizationâ€™s IT security. In this project, the use of Elasticsearch, Filebeat, and Packetbeat plays a significant role in building a basic SIEM solution. These tools work together to collect, analyze, and visualize security-related data, helping to detect and respond to potential threats effectively.

## Types of Logs Managed

In this project, I managed various types of logs to ensure comprehensive monitoring and analysis:

- **Network Logs**: Captured using Packetbeat, these logs provide insights into network traffic, including protocols like HTTP, DNS, and TLS, helping to detect unusual network activities or potential security threats.
- **System Logs**: Collected via Filebeat, these logs include vital system events such as login attempts, user activities, and system errors, which are crucial for monitoring the health and security of servers.
- **Web Logs**: These logs track web server activities, including HTTP requests and responses, enabling the analysis of web traffic, user behavior, and potential security issues like unauthorized access or data breaches.

## Log Management Infrastructure
- **Log Generation**: The first level concerns log generation, where various equipment and systems produce the necessary data.

- **Data Analysis, Filtering, and Storage**: At the second level, data analysis, filtering, and storage involves one or more servers dedicated to log management, ensuring that the information is properly processed and stored for future use.

- **Log Visualization and Monitoring**: The third level, log visualization and monitoring, includes consoles that allow system administrators to view the data in real time and take necessary actions to maintain network security and performance.
