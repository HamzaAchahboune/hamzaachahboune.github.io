# Chocolatey: A guide to windows package management
![Alt text](image.png)
## Introduction

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows that automates the process of installing, updating, and managing software. It simplifies the software management process by providing a command-line interface to handle package installations and updates. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of Chocolatey.

Package managers allow you to:

* Download and install software without having to go to different web pages.
* Verify packages have not been tampered with so that you donâ€™t end up with malware from MITM attacks.
* Install multiple packages for you and even make sure to install other software that an app may require.
* Upgrade and remove packages
Search for packages.
* And much more.
